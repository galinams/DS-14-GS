    "### Project problem and Hypothesis\n",
    "* The project focuses on the customer behavior dataset provided by Expedia. Within this project, I will look how likely Expedia customers are to book based on how they access the website (mobile app versus desktop). Furthermore, out of the customers accessing Expedia mobile app, which hotel cluster are they going to book.\n",
    "* The training dataset consists of over 37M records. The size of the dataset and the nature of the project reqire application of machine learning. The project will be predicting a binary outcome (is booking/is not booking) and a categorical variable which is presented as a number (hotel cluster).\n",
    "*  Customer behavior predictions are valuable for various aspects of Expedia operations from forecasting to marketing decisions. Potential uses are Expedia hotel recommendations based on the hotel cluster searched, consumer response optimization, website layout for repeat customers, and leveraging hotel relationships. \n"

    "### Project Concerns\n",
    "* I am concerned about the dataset size. Also, the outcome variable (hotel cluster) is assigned a number, and there is no description which hotels constitute a cluster. I also have general question: how to decide which model to fit. I am not sure how to work with date and time variables ('date time','srch_ci','srch_co') and how to make transformations.\n",
    "* The original comptetition also has an additional dataset with destination characteristcs, which I decided not to use. It was mentioned on the competition forum that many contestants had problems with data \"leakage\" from the destination dataset.\n",
    "* I wish I had a description of the hotel clusters. Even if I come up with a predition, I will not be able to explain what kind of hotels are booked under the conditions. \n",
    "* Comptetion description states that the \"data in this competition is a random selection from Expedia and is not representative of the overall statistics\".\n",
    "* I chose the Kaggle dataset for my final project over work-related problem so that there is no implications if my model is wrong. Additionaly, the Kaggle competition is over so that there is no additional factors influencing my desicion. The benefit of my model being right is the knowledge that I will acquire in the process. Additional benefit is that the project is in the hospitality field.\n",
    "* 'orig_destination_distance' variable is physical distance between the customer and the hotel, however, there are null values if the distance could not be calculated. I think that the distance is an important variable in predicting both where or not a booking was made and the hotel cluster. Depending on how many null values there are, it may have impact on the predictions. \n"
